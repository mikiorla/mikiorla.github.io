## "Enable Trust" in Compute Managers in NSX

### Overview

The **"Enable Trust"** option in the Compute Managers section of VMware NSX is used to establish a **two-way trust relationship** between NSX Manager and a compute manager, typically vCenter Server. This trust is essential for certain NSX features and integrations, especially with newer vSphere functionalities.

### Purpose and Use Cases

- **Trusted Communication:** Enabling trust ensures that NSX Manager and vCenter Server can securely and reliably communicate. This is crucial for services running in vCenter, such as vSphere Lifecycle Manager and Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, which require trusted integration with NSX[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3].
- **vSphere Lifecycle Manager:** For NSX clusters managed by vSphere Lifecycle Manager (vLCM), enabling trust is mandatory. Without it, NSX cannot be enabled on vLCM-enabled clusters, and certain automation or lifecycle operations will fail[^1_2][^1_4][^1_5][^1_6].
- **Enhanced Security:** The trust relationship involves certificate validation and thumbprint verification, ensuring that both NSX and vCenter can authenticate each other's identities before exchanging sensitive information[^1_1][^1_2].

### How It Works

- When you add a compute manager (such as vCenter) in NSX, you have the option to enable trust.
- If enabled, NSX and vCenter exchange certificates, and you may be prompted to accept the vCenter server's thumbprint if it is not already provided.
- Once trust is established, services like vSphere Lifecycle Manager and Kubernetes integrations can operate seamlessly with NSX[^1_2][^1_3].


### Typical Scenarios for Enabling Trust

- **Deploying NSX on vSphere 7.0 or later:** Trust must be enabled for full integration.
- **Using vSphere Lifecycle Manager:** Required for managing NSX clusters through vLCM[^1_2][^1_4][^1_5].
- **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integration:** Trust is necessary for Kubernetes workloads managed by vCenter and NSX[^1_3][^1_7].


### Summary Table

| Feature/Scenario | Is "Enable Trust" Required? | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| vSphere Lifecycle Manager (vLCM) | Yes | Required for NSX enablement on vLCM clusters[^1_2][^1_4][^1_5][^1_6] |
| Tanzu Kubernetes Grid | Yes | Needed for trusted communication[^1_3][^1_7] |
| Basic vCenter Integration | Optional | Recommended for enhanced security[^1_2][^1_3] |

### Additional Notes

- If the vCenter's FQDN, IP, or certificate thumbprint changes after registration, you must update the trust settings in NSX[^1_2].
- If trust is not enabled, you may encounter errors or limited functionality when integrating NSX with other VMware products[^1_5][^1_6].

**In summary:**
Enabling trust for Compute Managers in NSX is a security and integration feature that allows for secure, two-way communication between NSX Manager and vCenter Server. It is essential for advanced features like vSphere Lifecycle Manager and Kubernetes integrations, ensuring that both systems can authenticate and trust each other for seamless operations[^1_2][^1_4][^1_3].
