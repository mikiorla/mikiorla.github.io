Hi, I’m Milan Orlovic. I have been working in IT for over 20 years — actually, my entire professional career.
Throughout this time, I’ve gained extensive experience in various areas of information technology, focusing on infrastructure, virtualization, and cloud technologies.
I have a strong passion for automation, especially using PowerShell, which helps me streamline tasks, improve efficiency, and solve complex problems.I enjoy sharing knowledge and helping others navigate the ever-evolving world of IT
